Plant cells have cell walls, chloroplasts, and large vacuoles; animal cells lack these. Key components include: cell membrane (selective barrier), cytoplasm (internal environment), nucleus (control center), mitochondria (energy production), vacuoles (storage).\n* **Organization:** Cells → Tissues → Organs → Organ Systems → Organism.\n* **Diversity:** Six kingdoms classify organisms. Focus on plant and animal distinctions (food production, mobility).  Within animals: vertebrates (backbone) vs. invertebrates. Within plants: vascular (transport systems) vs. nonvascular.  Fungi (absorb food), bacteria (lack nucleus), and protists (diverse, often single-celled) complete the kingdoms.\n\n\n**Chapter 2: Plant-Specific Details**\n\n* **Reproduction:** Spores (single-celled reproductive units) vs. seeds (undeveloped plant with stored food). Angiosperms (flowering) vs. gymnosperms (non-flowering). Pollination crucial for seed plant reproduction.\n* **Transport:** Xylem transports water/minerals upwards from roots.\n\n\n**Chapter 3: Human Systems (Overview)**\n\n* **Digestive System:** Processes food for energy and nutrient absorption.\n* **Respiratory System:** Gas exchange (oxygen in, carbon dioxide out).\n* **Circulatory System:** Transports nutrients, gases, and wastes throughout the body.\n* **Excretory System:** Removes metabolic wastes.\n\n\nRemember these key distinctions and processes for a strong understanding of the structure of living things."

Aquifers supplement this, providing about one-third of our fresh water, especially during droughts.  However, over-reliance on aquifers risks depletion and ground collapse.  Water is stored and moved via human-made systems: dams create reservoirs, and aqueducts, like the California Aqueduct (State Water Project) and those within the Central Valley Project (federal), transport water long distances.  Reclamation plants treat used water for purposes like aquifer recharge, increasing the water table and well water levels."

It's essentially the weight of the air column above a given area.\n\n* **Atmosphere:** The air surrounding Earth, composed primarily of nitrogen and oxygen. The troposphere is the lowest layer where weather occurs.  Higher altitudes have less air, hence lower pressure.\n\n* **Factors Affecting Air Pressure:**\n    * **Altitude:** Inverse relationship. Higher altitude = lower pressure (shorter air column).\n    * **Temperature:** Inverse relationship. Higher temperature = lower pressure (molecules spread out).\n    * **Space/Volume:** Inverse relationship. Smaller volume = higher pressure (molecules more crowded).\n    * **Humidity:** Inverse relationship. Higher humidity = lower pressure (water vapor is lighter than other air molecules).\n\n\n* **Measurement:** Barometer.\n\n\n* **Visualization:** Imagine columns of air stacked on the Earth's surface.  A taller column (sea level) exerts more pressure than a shorter column (mountaintop).  Also, imagine squeezing air into a smaller container - more collisions, higher pressure."

Aneroid barometers measure the changes in the size of an airtight container compressed by air pressure.  Air pressure is affected by temperature, altitude, and humidity.

This leads to coastal areas having milder climates (less extreme temperature swings) than inland areas.  Summers are cooler, winters are warmer by the coast.\n\n* **Convection:** Temperature differences create pressure differences (higher temperature = lower pressure). Air moves from high to low pressure, transferring heat via convection. This drives both local breezes and global wind patterns.\n\n* **Global Winds/Trade Winds:**  Example: Trade winds, blowing northeast to southwest, are driven by pressure differences between the higher-pressure tropics (30°N/S) and the lower-pressure equator.  These are part of the larger global wind system, consistently moving from high to low pressure areas.\n\n* **Ocean Currents:**  Ocean currents, like the California Current, are continuous movements of ocean water. Warm currents from the equator moderate temperatures in higher latitudes, while cold currents from the poles cool lower latitudes.  These currents influence the air temperature of nearby landmasses."

This means the distance between the orbiting object and the central object varies throughout the orbit.\n* **Weightlessness in Orbit:**  The feeling of weightlessness experienced in orbit is not the absence of gravity, but rather the constant state of freefall. Gravity is still acting on the orbiting object, but the object's forward motion creates a continuous fall around the central object.\n* **Tides:** Caused primarily by the Moon's gravity pulling on Earth's oceans.  The Sun also contributes, but to a lesser extent.  Two high tides and two low tides occur each day due to Earth's rotation and the Moon's gravitational pull."

Lunar gravity is the dominant force due to the Moon's proximity, despite its smaller mass compared to the Sun.\n* **Tides:** Rise and fall of ocean surface.  Generally two high and two low tides per 24-hour period due to Earth's rotation.  Bulges occur on sides facing towards and away from the Moon.\n* **Spring Tides:** Higher high tides, lower low tides. Occur when Earth, Moon, and Sun are aligned (new and full moon).  Gravitational forces combine.\n* **Neap Tides:** Less difference between high and low tides. Occur when Sun and Moon are at right angles relative to Earth (first and third quarter moons). Gravitational forces partially cancel."

Density describes how tightly packed matter is within a given volume.  State changes occur with temperature changes (melting, freezing, boiling, condensation).\n\n**Elements:** Simplest substances, composed of atoms.  Atoms contain protons (+ charge), neutrons (no charge) in the nucleus, and electrons (- charge) orbiting the nucleus. Atomic number = number of protons. Atomic weight = protons + neutrons. Molecules are formed from two or more bonded atoms (e.g., O2, H2O).  Key element classifications: metals (good conductors), nonmetals (poor conductors), and metalloids (intermediate conductivity).  The periodic table organizes elements by atomic number, with elements in the same column (group/family) sharing similar properties.\n\n**Mixtures:** Combinations of substances retaining their individual properties. Can be separated by physical means (filtering, density separation, evaporation, magnetism).  Suspensions: mixtures where particles settle over time. Solutions: homogenous mixtures where particles (atoms/molecules) are uniformly distributed. Solutions consist of a solvent (the dissolver) and a solute (the dissolved substance). Solubility limits exist.\n\n**Compounds:** Formed by chemical changes, where reactants combine to create products with different properties.  Named using element names (e.g., iron oxide) and represented by chemical formulas (e.g., H2O). Prefixes (e.g., *mono*, *di*) indicate atom ratios in compounds. Compounds are identified by their unique properties (density, color, melting point, etc.). Hydrocarbons (hydrogen and carbon compounds) and plastics are important compound classes."

    "content": "Salts: Key Revision Points\n\n* **Definition:** Compounds formed from metal and nonmetal.  Table salt (sodium chloride, NaCl) is an example.\n* **Formation:**  Created by reactions between acids and bases. The acid provides the nonmetal, the base the metal component.  Example: HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H₂O.  Dissolving in water creates charged particles (ions) that conduct electricity (e.g., NaCl in water becomes Na⁺ and Cl⁻).  Not all salts dissolve readily.\n* **Properties:** Orderly structure gives them a crystalline, box-like shape and hardness. High melting points (e.g., table salt melts at 801°C).\n* **Acids:** Sour taste, turn litmus paper red. Formulas start with H (hydrogen). Release H⁺ ions in water.\n* **Bases:** Bitter taste, slippery feel, turn litmus paper blue. Formulas end in OH. Release OH⁻ ions in water.\n* **Neutralization:** Acids and bases react to form salts and water, canceling each other's acidic/basic properties.\n* **pH Scale:** Measures acid/base strength (0-14). 7 is neutral.  Lower pH = stronger acid, higher pH = stronger base.  H⁺ concentration higher at low pH, OH⁻ concentration higher at high pH.\n* **Uses of Salts:** Preserving food (inhibits bacterial growth), seasoning, curing, canning, pickling, de-icing (lowers freezing point of water).  Obtained from natural sources like evaporated seawater or underground deposits."

In water, release OH– ions (making them conductive). Examples: soap, ammonia cleaner, lye.\n* **Neutralization:** Acids and bases react to form salts (metal + nonmetal compounds) and water.  The acid provides the nonmetal, the base provides the metal. The resulting salt is neither acidic nor basic. Example: HCl (acid) + NaOH (base) → NaCl (salt) + H₂O.\n* **Salt Properties:** Crystalline structure (box-like grains), high melting points.  Dissolve in water to varying degrees.  Dissolved salts conduct electricity due to the presence of charged metal and nonmetal ions. Example: NaCl in water → Na⁺ + Cl⁻.\n* **Strength:** Acid/base strength is measured on the pH scale (0-14). 0 = strongest acid, 7 = neutral, 14 = strongest base.  pH reflects the relative concentration of H⁺ (acidic) and OH⁻ (basic) ions. Low pH = more H⁺, high pH = more OH⁻."

Strong acids (e.g., those that can corrode metal) react more vigorously than weak acids (e.g., vinegar). Similarly, strong bases (e.g., lye) react more intensely than weak bases.\n\n* **pH Scale:**  The pH scale quantifies this strength, ranging from 0 (strongest acid) to 14 (strongest base). 7 is neutral (pure water).\n\n* **Charged Particles:**  Acidity and basicity relate to the concentration of charged hydrogen (H⁺) and hydroxide (OH⁻) ions in solution:\n    * **Acids (pH < 7):** More H⁺ than OH⁻. Lower pH = higher H⁺ concentration.\n    * **Bases (pH > 7):** More OH⁻ than H⁺. Higher pH = higher OH⁻ concentration.\n    * **Neutral (pH = 7):** Equal concentrations of H⁺ and OH⁻.\n\n* **Indicators:** Litmus paper is an indicator: red in acids, blue in bases.\n\n* **Neutralization:** Acids and bases react to form salts, neutralizing each other in the process.

      "\n",
      "* **Orbit:** The path of one object around another (e.g., planet around a star).  Maintained by the interplay of gravity and inertia.\n",
      "* **Gravity:**  Mutual attraction between objects with mass.  Strength depends on the masses of the objects and the distance between them.  Pulls objects together.  In the context of orbits, gravity pulls the orbiting object towards the central object.\n",
      "* **Inertia:** Tendency of a moving object to continue moving in a straight line at a constant speed, or a stationary object to remain at rest. In orbits, inertia counteracts gravity's inward pull, preventing the orbiting object from falling directly into the central object.\n",
      "* **Orbital Shape:** Elliptical (a flattened circle).  This means the distance between the orbiting object and the central object varies throughout the orbit.\n",
      "* **Weightlessness in Orbit:**  The feeling of weightlessness experienced in orbit is not the absence of gravity, but rather the constant state of freefall. Gravity is still acting on the orbiting object, but the object's forward motion creates a continuous fall around the central object.\n",
      "* **Tides:** Caused primarily by the Moon's gravity pulling on Earth's oceans.  The Sun also contributes, but to a lesser extent.  Two high tides and two low tides occur each day due to Earth's rotation and the Moon's gravitational pull.\n",

      "* **Gravity** between Earth and the Moon (and Sun) causes tides.  Lunar gravity is the dominant force due to the Moon's proximity, despite its smaller mass compared to the Sun.\n",
      "* **Tides:** Rise and fall of ocean surface.  Generally two high and two low tides per 24-hour period due to Earth's rotation.  Bulges occur on sides facing towards and away from the Moon.\n",
      "* **Spring Tides:** Higher high tides, lower low tides. Occur when Earth, Moon, and Sun are aligned (new and full moon).  Gravitational forces combine.\n",
      "* **Neap Tides:** Less difference between high and low tides. Occur when Sun and Moon are at right angles relative to Earth (first and third quarter moons). Gravitational forces partially cancel.\n",

Density describes how tightly packed matter is within a given volume.  State changes occur with temperature changes (melting, freezing, boiling, condensation).\n",

      "**Elements:** Simplest substances, composed of atoms.  Atoms contain protons (+ charge), neutrons (no charge) in the nucleus, and electrons (- charge) orbiting the nucleus. Atomic number = number of protons. Atomic weight = protons + neutrons. Molecules are formed from two or more bonded atoms (e.g., O2, H2O).  Key element classifications: metals (good conductors), nonmetals (poor conductors), and metalloids (intermediate conductivity).  The periodic table organizes elements by atomic number, with elements in the same column (group/family) sharing similar properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Mixtures:** Combinations of substances retaining their individual properties. Can be separated by physical means (filtering, density separation, evaporation, magnetism).  Suspensions: mixtures where particles settle over time. Solutions: homogenous mixtures where particles (atoms/molecules) are uniformly distributed. Solutions consist of a solvent (the dissolver) and a solute (the dissolved substance). Solubility limits exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Compounds:** Formed by chemical changes, where reactants combine to create products with different properties.  Named using element names (e.g., iron oxide) and represented by chemical formulas (e.g., H2O). Prefixes (e.g., *mono*, *di*) indicate atom ratios in compounds. Compounds are identified by their unique properties (density, color, melting point, etc.). Hydrocarbons (hydrogen and carbon compounds) and plastics are important compound classes.\n",
